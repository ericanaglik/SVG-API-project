## Uses and Features 
### Uses
   - SVG is a Standard Vector Graphic format based on XML. SVG are plain text files used to display a variety of graphics on the web.

### Features
#### All features have a link to additional documentation
1. [Positions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Positions):
      - SVG uses a grid system with coordinates for placing shapes and objects on a website
  
2. [Basic Shapes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Basic_Shapes): 
      - Rectangles, circles, ellipses, lines, polylines, polygons, and paths
      
3. [Paths](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths):
      - Paths create complex shapes by combining multiple straight lines or curved lines.

4. [Fills and Strokes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Fills_and_Strokes): 
      - Creates basic coloring. Fill sets the inside color and stroke sets the line border color
  
5. [Gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Gradients):
      - Liner gradient creates a gradient of colors you choose that change along a straight line
  
6. [Pattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Patterns): 
      - Inside the pattern element you can include any of the other basic shapes you've included, as well as style them in any of the styles you've learned before
  
7. [Texts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Texts): 
      - Used to put arbitrary text in SVG documents
      
8. [Basic Transformations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Basic_Transformations):
      - Allows you to move elements around, rotate, skew, and scale
      
9. [Clipping and Masking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Clipping_and_masking):
- Clipping:
      -Refers to removing elements defined by other parts 
      
- Masking:
      - Refers to applying a mask to a shape, determining what parts of the shape are visible and at what transparency
      
10. [Embedding Raster Images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Other_content_in_SVG):
      - The embedded picture becomes a normal SVG element. This allows you to use clips, masks, filters, rotations and any other SVG tools on the new picture
      
11. [Filters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Filter_effects): 
      - Create complex effects like blur and shadows
      
12. [SVG Image Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/SVG_Image_Tag): 
      - Allows for raster images to be rendered within an SVG object
